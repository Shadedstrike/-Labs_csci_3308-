The contents are as follows.


Lab 1: Created a basic nodeJS server to host "hello world" http content. I set up a postgres db, and enabled git.

Lab 4: Built a simple shell scripts for automatic monitoring emails from hosts, via cronjobs. I also practiced regex.

       Bootstrap classes were also used to add functionality to the site.
       
Lab 7: Created SQL scripts and commands to adjust and filter sql database entries.
